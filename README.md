This a website I created for the HackViolet 2022 hackathon.

✨Inspiration✨
We wanted to help female college graduates find jobs by providing them with free and easy-to-use resources.

✨What it does✨
HireMeAnywhere has three features including a resume builder, portfolio templates, and mentorship opportunities. The Resume Builder feature allows you to build a resume by providing skills and experiences. It then takes the information provided and generates a resume starter for the user to download. The Build Your Portfolio section gives the user templets for building their own portfolio website. This section also provides tips and more information about what a portfolio is, how to build one, and why a portfolio is important. The Mock Interview feature allows users to complete a form which applies them to recieve mentorship towards finding a job. These mentors will provide tips and tricks for interviewing and will also host mock interviews with their mentee. We also included a feature that allows people to apply to become a mentor.

✨How we built it✨
We built the project this project with basic HTML, CSS, W3.CSS, and Javascript. We also used a small JavaScript library that allows the users to download a PDF, the library can be found here: https://codewithmark.com/html-to-pdf.

✨Challenges we ran into✨
Some of us worked for 5+ hours straight without taking breaks and I feel like a break from time to time would've been necessary. Some of us were also focusing too much on the small details and not prioritizing what was most important. 

✨Accomplishments that we're proud of✨
We're all proud of ourselves for being able to communicate with one another when an issue arose and being able to work effectively together in a team. There was also an
interchange of encouragement.

✨What we learned✨
We learned how to work in teams and debug our code effectively. We also learned that communication is key when working in teams. Assigning roles to each other is also important.

✨What's next for Hire Me Anywhere✨
We hope to make Hire Me Anywhere as responsive as possible and upgrade its styling. We also hope for Hire Me Anywhere to be a platform for recent female graduates to seek and find jobs once they enter the workforce.

✨Built With✨
We used Visual Studio Code to write our HTML/CSS files. We also used an online logo maker to create the logo for our website. The website we used to make out logo is https://www.freelogodesign.org/.
